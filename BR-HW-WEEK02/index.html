				JONATHAN - questions I still have: 1) having trouble centering things in a div - like the first button. I had to cheat and make a div-3andhalf then the button w/ padding, and then another div-4 to get it to align in the center vertically. 2) a little confused if I used the classes and Ids correctly - can't they both do the same thing if you're only doing it once? 3) trouble centering things to look always centered no matter the screen - I don't understand marin: 0 auto and it doesn't seem to ever work for me. 4) had trouble justifying and centering the block quote, I looked online and copied a code but dont know what moz text align means but it seemd to work. okay probably more questiosn but thats if for now, thanks!</h3>
