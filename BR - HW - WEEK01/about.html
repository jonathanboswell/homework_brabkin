	<h1>Beth Rabkin</h1>
	<h2>About me</h2>
	<h2>B.A., History and Art History, Georgetown University, 2003</h2>
	<h2>M.Arch., University of Pennsylvania, 2007</h2>
	<p> This is where I talk about the bio bla bla. this is where people have things to say. bla bla. I live in a little bungalow in venice and have the best pet rabbit in the world named Otis. Nobody cares about resumes anyway. I don't understand how come now if I want to make an another heading it just turns the same color as the links and I dont know how to target two images if I want them to do different things. Tried using that word div which seemed to work. I can't center things in the page with 0 auto. doesn't seem to work. Also I wanted to make a block list for the schools but since I had the other list for the nav didnt know how to do it not inline. I also wanted to put the about me and the text in columbs side by side - but this will do for now</p>
